# mediawiki-api-client

This is a client for the MediaWiki API. It uses [Guzzle][1] web service library. The client API is a custom web service client based on `Guzzle\Service\Client`.

**WARNING** This client is in no way feature-complete! It only implements the API functions that I need at the moment. Feel free to contribute by expanding the [json file](src/Birke/Mediawiki/Api/client.json) and adding a test.

## Installation

Use composer to install the library and all its dependencies:

composer require "gbirke/mediawiki-api:dev-master" 

## Basic Usage example
